# An-E-commerce-Created-Using-Django
This is an E-commerce site where we will create  a site which client can be able to view a list of music instruments on our site, view a single instrument on its on page, and the product to a shopping cart.
I will also integrate our system with a payment system like stripe but we will take it one step at time.

## Our Technology
We will be using Django Web Framework and Python programming language to create this site. We will also be using
Twitter Bootstrap Framework for our front-end.

### Project Status
So far we have created I simple function to render our index page, we can also be able to serve our static files
like css, js, image etc. We have also configure our database setting, we will be using mysql but you can use
the database of your choice. Django support some of the most popular databases like oracle, sqlite etc.

### Motivation
The main reason behind the creation of this project is to set a new challenge for myself because as programmer
you learn by doing, the second reason is to be able to be part of the community that contribute knowledge to
open source and lastly, to sharpen my problems solving skills.

### Installation
You can clone the project to you local storage or download zip file and extract it to your local storage.
The second thing is to navigate to the root of the project and locate settings.py file and configure your
database and run migration: You can use this command python manage.py migrate

To be on the safe side I recommend that you use PyCharm as your text editor since Python uses indentation for
a particular code block. Sometimes wrong indentation can be frustrating.

### Note
This is an active project that I will be working on as time goes by, visit the repo and see whether there is
an update.
